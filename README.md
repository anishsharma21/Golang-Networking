# Golang-Networking

This repository contains my journey of learning Go networking. It includes various lessons and projects that demonstrate different aspects of networking in Go, from the basics to more advanced concepts.

## Structure

- `archive/lessons-and-exercises/`: Contains initial exercises and lessons on basic networking concepts such as dialing in and listening, and simple TCP client and server programs.
- `fundamentals/`: Contains lessons that build on the basics, introducing more complex topics and implementations.
- `projects/`: Contains more advanced projects that apply the concepts learned in the lessons.
  - `simple_chatserver/`: A simple chat server and client implementation.
  - `intermediate_chatserver/`: A more advanced chat server and client with concurrency and custom protocols.

## Projects

The `projects/` folder contains more advanced implementations:

- **Simple Chat Server**: A basic chat server and client.
- **Intermediate Chat Server**: An advanced chat server and client with concurrency and custom protocols.
